# MeadowCLI

## Build Status
[![Build](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.CLI/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.CLI/actions)

## Getting Started

Note: For OSX users, [this line](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/MeadowCLI/blob/master/MeadowCLI/DfuSharp.cs#L29) needs to be changed to `libusb-1.0` TODO: determine OS at runtime or handle fallback

The CLI tool supports DFU flashing for `nuttx.bin` and `nuttx_user.bin`. When the application is run with `-d`, it looks for `nuttx.bin` and `nuttx_user.bin` in the application directory and if not found, it will abort. Optionally, paths for the files can be specific with `--osFile` and `--userFile`.

The CLI tool also supports device and file management including file transfers, flash partitioning, and MCU reset.

To run MeadowCLI on Windows, run meadow.exe from the command prompt. On Mac and Windows, call **mono meadow.exe**.

## Options

To see the options, run the application with the --help arg.

## Running Commands

### Specifying the Serial Port
File and device commands require you to specify the serial port (`-s` or `--SerialPort`). You can determine the serial port name in Windows by viewing the Device Manager. The CLI will remember the last Serial Port used, so you only need to specify it if you need to change the value.

On Mac and Linux, the serial port will show up in the **/dev** folder, generally with the prefix **tty.usb**. You can likely find the serial port name by running the command `ls /dev/tty.usb`.

### Setting the Log Verbosity
Appending `-v` or `-vv` to any command will increase the logging verbosity to `Debug` and `Trace` respectively. `Trace` should only be necessary when debugging issues with the CLI.

### Getting Help
Specifying `--help` with no command will output the list of available commands. Specifying `--help` with a command (eg: `meadow file delete --help`) will output command specific help.
```
meadow v0.13.0

USAGE
  meadow file delete --files <values...> [options]

DESCRIPTION
  Delete files from the Meadow File System

OPTIONS
* -f|--files        The file(s) to delete from the Meadow Files System
  -v                Log verbosity
  -s|--port         Meadow COM port Default: "COM19".
  -h|--help         Shows help text.
```

## Useful commands

### Update the Meadow OS
```
meadow flash os
```

### Listen for Meadow Console.WriteLine
```
meadow listen
```

### Set the trace level

You can set the debug trace level to values 0, 1, 2, or 3. 2 is the most useful.
```
meadow trace enable --level 2
```

### File transfers
```
meadow files write -f [NameOfFile]
```
You may specify multiple instances of `-f` to send multiple files

### List files in flash
```
meadow files list
```

### Delete a File

```
meadow files delete -f [NameOfFile]
```
You may specify multiple instances of `-f` to send multiple files

### Stop/start the installed application from running automatically
```
meadow mono disable
meadow mono enable
```
### Useful utilities
```
meadow device info
meadow device name
```

### Debugging
**NOTE THIS IS NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED, IT WILL NOT WORK**
```
meadow debug -p XXXX
```
This starts listening on the specified port for a debugger to attach

Note: you can use SDB command line debugger from https://github.com/mono/sdb. Just build it according to its readme, run the above command and then:

```
sdb "connect 127.0.0.1 XXXX"
``` 
Substitute XXXX for the same port number as above

## Running applications

You'll typically need at least 5 files installed to the Meadow flash to run a Meadow app:

1. System.dll
2. System.Core.dll
3. mscorlib.dll
4. Meadow.Core.dll
5. App.exe (your app)

It's a good idea to disable mono first, copy the files, and then enable mono


## Source Code Quality

This code is ugly. We know. :) Lots of different coding styles, spanning many decades and sensibilities.
